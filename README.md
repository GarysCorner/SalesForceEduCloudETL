# SalesForceEduCloudETL

This is a simple script/notebook I wrote to move data from salesforce education cloud tables into my MSSQL server.  It uses the simple_saleforce library.

This is provided as is with no warrenties.  The project is missing most traditional customization options.  I uploaded this in case anyone else can use it if they like but its not actively maintained or anything.
